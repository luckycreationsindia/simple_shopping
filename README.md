# 👖👕 Simple Shopping - Shopping made Simple and Easier

A Flutter UI template of a Simple Shopping App Design I found on Uplabs.

Design screens are on [Uplabs.](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/shopping-app-uikit) It's free but for personal use, purchase it if you want to use it commercially.

> **Disclaimer:** I am not in anyway in affiliate with the designer of the screens. I just love the UI and decided to code it in Flutter😽

Don't forget to star⭐ the repo if you like what you see😉.
